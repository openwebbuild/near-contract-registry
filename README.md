# NEAR Contract Registry

**Why Contract Registry?**

> It's frequently asked by developers about where to find the mainnet/testnet contract accounts, DApp URLs and source code of the smart contracts on NEAR. To make the contract metadata more discoverable, we created this summary page to make it easier to find all the necessary information about the contracts of the core projects on NEAR. 
> 
> The contract registry also helps improve the ecosystem security. For example, if the user is connecting the contract from a dapp URL that doesn't match with the contract address, the wallet will warn the user of potential risks.
 

## Contract Metadata

In the table, we have listed some of the most frequently asked contracts and projects. If you think your project should be listed, please feel free to create pull requests or submit issues.

The currently supported metadata includes

1. project name
2. contract source on GitHub
3. contract account on mainnet
4. app URL for mainnet
5. contract account on testnet
6. app URL for testnet

The testnet contracts and app URLs are usually helpful when developers are building their new contracts / DApps.

## What's Next?

This repo is only the initial version of the contract registry, and we'll add more enhancements later. 

- [ ] Create mainnet / testnet contract registry for storing the contract metadata that could be updated by the project DAOs or owners.
- [ ] Turn the contract registry to be maintained by a developer DAO from NEAR developer community.
